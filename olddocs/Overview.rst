Python Overview
===============


* Scripting language, interpreted high-level programming language for general-purpose programming.

* Creator (BDFL - Benevolent Dictator For Life) Guido Von Rossum developed in the 1980's, first release 1991.

* Python has a design philosophy that emphasizes code readability, notably using significant whitespace. It provides constructs that enable clear programming on both small and large scales.



* Many versions of Python; CPython, PyPy, Stackless Python, MicroPython.

* Cross-compliers; Jython (Java Bytecode), IronPython (.NET), Cython (C, C++), Grumpy (by Google complies to Go), etc...

* CPython is written in C and compiles Python programs into intermediate bytecode which is executed by the Python Virtual Machine.

* CPython has a very large library (OS, GUI, Database, Network, Web, ML/AI, Scientific, Data Analytics, etc)

=============
Zen of Python
=============

Long time Pythoneer Tim Peters succinctly channels the BDFL's 
guiding principles for Python's design into 20 aphorisms, 
only 19 of which have been written down.

    * Beautiful is better than ugly.
    * Explicit is better than implicit.
    * Simple is better than complex.
    * Complex is better than complicated.
    * Flat is better than nested.
    * Sparse is better than dense.
    * Readability counts.
    * Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
    * Although practicality beats purity.
    * Errors should never pass silently.
    * Unless explicitly silenced.
    * In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
    * There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
    * Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
    * Now is better than never.
    * Although never is often better than *right* now.
    * If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
    * If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
    * Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
